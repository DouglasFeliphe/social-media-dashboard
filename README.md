### Objective

Your challenge is to build a responsive Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains some of the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

-   Use **TypeScript** and **React**
-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Toggle color theme to their preference
    -   Persist this setting in localStorage
-   Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, flip the cards on click, to reveal information on the back)
    -   Describe the feature in a separate markdown file
-   **Bonus** Allow the cards to be rearranged (Drag & Drop) and persist the location to localStorage

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **TypeScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. 

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding.
